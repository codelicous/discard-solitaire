      <div class="title">Pair Removal Allowed</div>
      <div class="description">
        You can discard two card with different suit and same value (e.g prince heart and prince diamond)

      <div class="title">Aces are free</div>
      <div class="description">
        Aces be moved from one tableau pile to another, freeing up a space or whatever card they may be covering.
        The only exception to this rule is that an ace may not be moved onto another ace.

    <div [class.visible]="configurationService.selectedDifficulty <= difficultTypeEnum.Hard"
         class="rule">
      <div class="title">Can Discard Lower suite on top in same pile</div>
      <div class="description">
       you are allowed to remove a card if the card it is covering is of the same suit and a higher value.
        For example, if a tableau pile contained "3H,6S,JD,8D" (with the 8 of diamonds being the one exposed card),
        then this rule would allow you to remove the 8, because the card that it covers is the same suit (diamond), and is a higher value (jack is higher than 8).
